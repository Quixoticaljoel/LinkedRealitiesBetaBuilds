Description
Linked Realities is a VRMMO inspired by the Sword Art Online Anime.

This project is named "Linked Realities" due to what the game will contain, we are planning to have "worlds" like how you will see in VRChat as an example but with its own gameplay and mechanics built into each one, with this there is alot of work.

The target is to have a fun VR MMO experince while making a story that people will love using our community.

As a final message i hope once this game gets off the ground it will become one of the funniest VR MMO's out there, We are open to critism, and having a small player base. As long as we get this project to a point we are happy and the community is happy aswell, that is all that matters!

Linked Realities is heavily inspired by Sword Art Online the Anime and its games, and Zenith a VRMMO that is in Development you should check out as it has a bigger production than this by far!, also inspired by IBM's SAO: The Beginning Demo back in 2016 as that is what started this idea!
